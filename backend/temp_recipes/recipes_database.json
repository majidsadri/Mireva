Friends and family usually enjoy this treat. Tweak it to fit your family as I do mine! Enjoy with confectioners' sugar on top or cream cheese frosting!\"Made half the recipe and used half splenda. Turned out perfectly as muffins. Pumpkn pie lke spice flavor and moist, not gooey.This was a hit! Moist and light, with a sweet and spicy flavor :) I left out the mace, chocolate, and confectioners' sugar, and used a 2 quart baking dish (9 x 13 inch pan).Delicious, moist and didn't last!!! I ended up making 3 batches because it never would have made it to our Easter gathering. I thought I would try this for a change from pumpkin pie this Easter. Everyone Loved it. I wasn't sure at first about adding the semisweet chips but my daughter insisted and the little hint of chips was prefect. I left out the walnuts. I didn't have any ginger, clove or mace in the cupboard so I substituted for 2tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I am going to make it again this weekend for an other dinner gathering.This was very easy and very good.  I followed the recipe, except that I did not have mace but instead used 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon allspice.  I added the optional chocolate chips but next time I would probably leave those out, just my personal preference.  By all means give this recipe a try.  The measurements and cooking time were spot on.  Thanks Virginia Ann for sharing your recipe.",

I will personally add 1/2 tsp vanilla next time instead of 1tsp.Just like my momma use to make! Very tasty and easy.Super delicious and much better tasting than store bought. To be warned it does make a lot more whipped cream than you'd think, plus after whipping you should consider refrigerating it for a bit after to firm it up a bit after working it so much if it begins to melt.",

      "description": "\"Nice soft whole wheat bread with added grains. Makes a 2 large loaves. Double recipe for 3 smaller loaves.\"So delicious!! I couldn't find vital wheat gluten, so I omitted it, but it turned out great anyway. I also added more water in the kneading process. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!should have read the reviews first, but the water/flour ratio is off.  I am somewhat new at bread and kept thinking that I was not doing something right, but it was the ratios.This is great bread! I had to make some omissions based on what I had handy (no sesame, sunflower seeds or coconut oil. I tossed in some wheat germ instead - otherwise followed the recipe except for the shape...I got 6 sandwich rolls and 1 large bunny loaf out of this. Thanks for the recipe!One detail:  If you've had breast cancer that was estrogen-receptor positive, you should avoid flax seed and flax meal.  Either leave them out, or add more of the other seeds.Let me preface this by saying I am just starting to bake bread.  It is very difficult to find a recipe with 100% whole wheat.  The only modification I made to this recipe was to add an additional 4 Tbls water as I could not get my dough to form without. I just pulled it out of the oven and my husband and I both enjoyed a slice.  Great flavor and not too dense.  Next time I am going to try using just vitamin C and omit at least some of the wheat gluten.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe for healthy bread!This was my first time attempting bread and it came out great!  I didn't have the flax seeds (added a bit extra flax seed meal) or the coconut oil (substituted toasted sesame oil) and needed to add a bit more water to get the dough to form. Tried to use my kitchenaid mixer but ended up just making it smoke -- so did all kneading by hand.  I didn't knead for full times because I got tired, but it still came out great.   The bread was a big hit and now I'm going to use it for french toast.The bread was tasty and good for sandwiches but the flour / water content was off. I used more water and approximately 5 1/2 c flour.The bread turned out beautiful.  I did have to use 2 cups of water  instead of 1/34.  Also when you cover it, don't put saran wrap on it, it will stick. It was so good.  I will make it again.",

      "description": "\"Cake pan full of sinful delight. The lemon juice does all the cooking\"Cheers to the party-sized portion!  I had to make this immediately upon seeing the photo today. Used whipping cream from the refrigerated carton (on-hand), and it worked out wonderfully. This is a Restaurant-Style cheesecake for sure, only better. Used fresh, cut up, lightly sweetened strawberries on the side after chilling the cheesecake instead of using the strawberry pie filling.  Wonderful! Thank you for sharing the recipe.Good, but not my favorite. I prefer the recipe I already have. This was fantastic!! Made it the first time for 40 people &amp; got rave reviews.  I didn't put the cherries on until a couple of hours before serving &amp; my filling set up perfectly (don't know if holding off on the cherries had anything to do with that or not)!!!Excellent!!!! Oh my gosh was it ever good. We ended up serving it in bowls though as it didn't hold like a normal cheesecake does-don't worry-it's sooooo good you won't care!!!! YUM!!!! Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe!!!! Wonderful!! I hate cool-whip, so I substituted a pint of sweetened whipping cream. I also left off the cherry topping. It's a perfect alternatitive to painstakingly baking a cheesecake, especially in the summer.I now know why this is called 10 oound cheesecake.  It makes alot!  I topped my cheesecake with fresh strawberries.  This is a delicious recipe, thanks for sharing.  AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING. I have been trying to figure out how to replicate a recipe from a restaurant back home for \"no-bake\" cheesecake and this is almost IDENTICAL to it! I was thrilled w/ the huge portion too! :)  The lemon juice really adds some kick to this cheesecake. I wasn't sure if I would like it at first as I'm a very plain cheesecake lover, but this was amazing.  Next time I will add some crushed raspberries and cool whip to the top. YUMM!!!  Thanks for this great recipe!!Made this for a church gathering.  I used shredded coconut in the crust in place of the sugar and also added crushed walnuts.  Excellent.  Very easy to make and has a wonderful presence.  Thanks for posting it.",

      "description": "\"I did a combination of two recipes, peanut butter cookies with three ingredients and magic cookie bars. My brother-in-law loves magic cookie bars but is now gluten-free. I have been trying to come up with desserts for him so he doesn't feel left out. This is an amazing dessert and will stay fresh for days...if they last that long in your house! Perfect for Passover - no flour!\"I absolutely appreciate that someone took the time to find a gluten-free alternative crust to these bars. Thank you for offering an idea I would never have thought of on my own!\n\nAfter having made them, I believe that the peanut butter cookie base makes the squares far far too sweet and rich, and the peanut taste totally overpowers the rest of the nuts in the bars. At least for my tastes, anyway. My husband and his dad liked them, but they could only eat one square at a sitting.\n\nMy oven sucks, so I only realized later that the cookie base didn't cook/set as much as I would have liked. I would recommend longer than 8 minutes, and at a higher temp to at least set the PB.\n\n**It was easy to make and prep.** If you don't normally have these ingredients in your cupboard, you can save money by only buying the amount you need in the bulk section of your grocery store.\n\nI am going to try to find a gluten-free crust that is more like the original base I knew and loved when I ate gluten. Something less overpowering than the peanut butter.\n\nAll in all, nice to be able to make something to take to holiday parties that was gluten-free, but not many people ate them, and no one took a second.I make these for My Brother in Law who is Gluten Free. You can \"tweak\" the recipe and add tons of different kinds of nuts and chocolate candies and carmel on top. I switch it up all the time. Works best with parchment paper in the bottom of the pan.

I didn't have apple butter so per another user's suggestion, I used applesauce instead. These turned out great! The spices are just the right amount. And only 1 point if you're a WW person :)i love pumpkin! this was average, expected more. if you think  of it as little drops of cake instead of a cookie, you may enjoy it better. i looked up a 5 star cream cheese frosting to add some flavor and it was better. think i'll rename these \"iced pumpkin puffs\"! probably will try another recipe though....just being honest!These were pretty good. I made half of the batch with nuts, the other without. I personally liked them better without the nuts, but that's just because I'm not a big fan of walnuts. I really liked the fluffy texture. These are lightly, not overly spiced. For some reason every time I make pumpkin cookies I have an allergic skin reaction so I have to wear latex gloves :-P Edit: Beware! These cookies get very sticky on the surface after a while. It doesn't affect the taste, but it is kind of weird.I thought they were pretty good, but they were kind of mushy on the inside. I would add a minute to the bake time, but besides that, they were fine.I LOVE these!  I thought they might be a little heavy on the spices, but the balance was perfect, and I love the slightly different texture the oats add.  These will be in my favorite cookie file for sure!  I didn't add the nuts, no one here likes nuts, but the light muffin like texture is perfect!TASTEY!! It's the end of August and I pulled out a pkg of pumpkin puree (AR's Pumpkin Puree) I had in the freezer... and then goodness happened:) As I was adding the spices I got an excited flutter in my stomach reminding me of Fall and all things autumn. Thanks for an excellent recipe. I changed a couple things out of necessity(didn't have on hand or allergy) but I'm sure it didn't change the main objective or flavor/texture, it came out as described. Changes: whole wheat instead of all purpose flour, allspice instead of pumpkin pie spice, applesauce instead of apple butter and chocolate chips instead of walnuts(allergy). Very good recipe!!!I doubled this recipe and it lasted one day with the family and friends.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  will diffently be a keeper in my recipe book!!!  Next time I might try using a cream cheese icing, but then again maybe not.  The are soft and delicious the way they are!very good and much easier to make then expected! Was also worried that they may be too spicy but they turned out perfect, only baked them for 9 mins and they were delish! Will make over and over again!",

      "description": "\"These cupcakes are a little labor-intensive, but the end product is definitely worth the effort! Even though they don't have a liqueur incorporated with the cake, I call them zuccotto cupcakes because of the whipped cream filling and ganache topping. I made them for my own wedding, and have had to give out the recipe as well as make them for others' special events many times since!\"These were amazing! I used a regular home-made muffin dough (for 12 muffins: 2.5 cups flour, 1.5 cups white sugar, 5 eggs, 3/4 cups 2 tblsp margerine, 2 tblsp vanilla sugar, 2 tblsp baking powder), melted the chocholate and added some cocoa powder just to make the color more even. As I didn't have any toffee bits at hand and don't like nuts, I simply used the triple amount of raspberries. Oh yeah, and I replaced the butter in the frosting by sour cream, just to soothe my conscience about all the fatty calories :)\nChocolaty heaven!I was looking for a cupcake recipe that would be challenging, fun to do and unique. I found it! My boyfriend and his family absolutely loved them. And this was on the heels of them receiving a batch of professional cupcakes the week prior for a birthday. I highly recommend giving this one a shot. For you creative types, you will discover the versatility of this recipe and all kinds of ways you can make them your own by switching up ingredients. Have fun with this and be ready to wow your consumers!I made this for my family and they absolutely loved it. I am new at cooking and so for the exception of putting the filling in the middle this was pretty easy. The filling thing I need to practice.My wife and I made these cupcakes and it was our very first time making any cupcakes. Dont let it scare you away. ITS WORTH IT !!\n\nWe followed the recipe except we didnt mix the raspberries in with the filling , instead we filled the hole about a 1/3 of the way with some of the filling, put a raspberry inside and then topped it off with more filling.\nI love white chocolate, she loves raspberries. It coudlnt have been any better for the two of us. \nThey where so good i actually helped clean the dishes. Thats a first! :-)Every person who tried these fell over him/herself to tell me how amazing they were. One friend requested them for her birthday, another said I should open a bakery, another said they were the best thing she had ever tasted in her life. Needless to say, I think these were a win. For compliments like that, it was totally worth the 3 hours they took to make!These cupcakes are amazing. I followed the recipe exactly (well, almost exactly - I didn't use the hazelnuts because I forgot to put them on the grocery list)..I LOVE cupcakes and these have shot to the top of my cupcake list!  Make them  -  you will NOT be disappointed!This recipe is not a quick one, but it's worth it.  I made it three ways - cupcakes, mini cupcakes and I baked a 9\" round that I split and filled with the whipped cream.\n\nI wouldn't recommend doing the cake unless you slice it before you chill the frosting too much.  Both layers of frosting get very firm when chilled, which will make them really easy to transport without a lot of damage.\n\nThe minis came out nicely, and they're rich enough that it's a good bite.  I'd probably just do those next time.  For the minis though, I'd recommend slicing up fresh raspberries so that it's easier to pipe the cream into them.  Makes a really impressive little dessert - thank you!I haven't even finished them yet and I already love them... I've just tried the filling with a chunk of a cupcake that I cute out.  Soooo good!  Followed the recipe exactly :)",

      "description": "\"These grapes were served to me after a massage at my local spa. This recipe is perfect as an after-school snack, a simple appetizer at parties, or a sweet treat before bed. Substitute Splenda® for the sugar if you like! Can be kept in a sealed bag in the freezer for several months.\"\"Spectacular\" little recipe! Ya just gotta love it when a few items you have laying around the kitchen turn into something a little extra special...  I've frozen fruit before, but never grapes. And while they're delicious with or without sugar - that addition gave regular 'ol grapes a little pizzaz.  I did use less sugar than called for and opted for Spenda which made the amount even less.  This was so easy and tasted oh so good - very nice little treat without any guilt.No sweetener necessary, even for kids' tastes, and certainly \"spa\"-healthier without! Frozen grapes are awesome just by themselves... They're like little natural popsicles!You can also use Sugar Free Jello for an added flavor.Never mind the sugar and put them on long skewers for a fun treat.  They freeze beautifully and certainly are delicious.Really pretty and oh so tasty - I didn't use nearly as much sugar as called for - maybe 1 teaspoon total - This was just enough to give the grapes that crystal effect - they actually taste a bit like a sorbet.  Thanks for a fun idea.Awesome.  We really enjoyed this sugary frozen treat on a hot evening.  No need to even complete steps 4 and 5.  The grapes went straight into the freezer inside the resealable bag.  Easy and delicious!Agree that no sugar is needed.  I freeze them in snack-sized zip lock bags so so we can grab individual servings on the go (although you must eat them before they completely defrost or they will be mushy).Our grapes were extra sweet, so we didn't use sugar. This is something we actually do quite often. Just sticking them in the freezer and getting them out two hours later works well for snacks. Mmmmmm.",

      "description": "\"I made this recipe up one night when I had no idea what to do with a pound and a half of chicken tenderloins. It came out so well that my husband and I finished off the leftovers the next day and we are not usually leftover eaters. I am gluten-free so I used gluten-free cornbread mix. You will definitely enjoy it!\"Yum.  OH!  I made this as a one-dish crockpot recipe and it was delicious.  I used chicken breasts, not tenders, adding them raw to the seasoned tomato sauce mixture and cooking it all on LO for 3.5 hrs (less for tenders).  After adding in the rest and topping with the corn muffin mix, I cooked on HI for 1.5 hours.  Next time I'll add diced onion (1 sm) and 1-2 cloves minced garlic to the tomato sauce mixture, but even as is, this was great, and a keeper.  Thanks for posting!This recipe would've been great if I had followed the original recipe.  I followed the review that recommended I cook it in the crock pot.  After 5 hours, it was complete mush!  We dipped tortilla chips in it, but it was a little much to call it a main dish.  Next time I will follow the original recipe.  The flavors were great, but a little sweet.  I may look for a corn bread mix without sugar.This was so simple and fantastic!  I added red bell pepper, onion, and minced garlic; and substituted Costco rotisserie chicken pulled off the bone.  oohlala!This was easy and delicious. I didn't even  brown the chicken first. Just simmered it with the tomato sauce. My family loved it.I made this last night and thought it was great! I added some sauteed ingredients (a large minced onion, corn, chopped mixed bell pepper strips). I also added a can of Ro-Tel diced tomatoes and green chiles. I omitted the water and just used the juice from the Ro-Tel can. Lastly, I added about a teaspoon of cumin. I know it sounds like a lot of changes but at the end of the day, the basis of this recipe is great. Don't be afraid of the 1 1/2 T of chili powder. I thought it would be quite spicy with that much but it wasn't at all and I added the Ro-Tel too! Don't be afraid to continue what started this recipe in the first place...the pantry raid!This was awesome.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  For me this is pure comfort food; and it is so easy.  I cheated and used shredded rotisserie chicken, light cream cheese and substituted my customized Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread recipe with corn and jalapeños from this site instead of the cornbread mix.  So it was a super fast dinner.   Thanks for sharing a great recipe.This made a delicious and hearty meal. The only changes that I made were to use 2 cans of chicken, browned with onions and a tsp. minced garlic.  My family loved this one. I will definitely make it again.I made this tonight, and I didn't change one thing.  My husband asked for seconds and he is a picky eater. I loved the corn bread topping.",

      "description": "\"This recipe is ALWAYS a hit...with kids too! I used to call it my 'Million Dollar Salad' because buying the sesame seeds was so expensive. Now I buy the sesame seeds in bulk at a health food store and it's much more affordable.\"I have made this salad many times and it is a family favorite.  I cut oil down to 1/3 cup and use a 1/3 cup of Balsalmic vinegar.  I add chopped garlic, decrease sugar to 1/4 cup and add 5-6 packets of splenda.   This salad can also be made with Romaine lettuce and cranberries instead of cabbage for a little holiday flare.Good salad, a little sweet for my taste though.  I will definitely try it again, but will modify the amount of sugar.My whole family loves it!  Here are my modifications: I cut the sugar in 1/2.   My kids are not fans of onion so I omit them or put them on the side.  For a bit more flavor I like a bit of chopped fresh flat leaf parsley and shredded carrot(2T) which makes this salad even more vibrant looking.    A tip I'd like to share is to add about 1/2 tsp. sesame oil.  This gives a wonderful flavor.  The  dressing will  emulsify and not seperate once it's cold so chill it and whisk again before pouring on.   I like to pour the dressing about 15 minutes before eating or the ramen is too crunchy for me! :)I've added chunk cooked chicken breasts, Pinneapple and sometimes mandarin orangesMy mom used to make this when I was a kid. It is an awesome salad for either every day or to bring to a potluck.I emulsified the dressing so that it wouldn't separate overnight as I knew I'd be using the leftover dressing. Otherwise I followed the directions as written, only I keep the crunchy bits as a topping at the last minute instead of mixing in as we can't eat the whole salad in one sitting. Thanks for sharing your recipe!Great recipe.  Family loved it.  Making it again tonight.We are diabetic and looking for new and different recipes that can be tailored to our diet concerns.  I thought that I would try this one.  It was great.  I did have to make substations of course.  Splenda for the sugar and I did not use the raman noodles.  I did up the nuts a bit.  Hubby loved it and I may add more green onion.  Hubby wanted to try some chopped water chestnuts.  Thank you for sharing.",

      "description": "\"This is a combinations of some of my favorite cheesecake recipes. I took this into work and it lasted 30 minutes. The professional baker I work with called this cake 'restaurant quality.' I highly recommend a chocolate ganache to finish it off before serving (8 ounces semisweet chocolate combined with 1/2 cup hot whipping cream) spread over the top! Garnish the side of the cake with toasted coconut if desired.\"This is so good. Everyone loved it.So I was a little hesitant to try this until I saw a few more reviews... But then I got into an extremely boring stretch of homework and decided to try it.  Man this is good... it tastes like eating a peanut butter banana sandwich on graham cracker bread.  I decided to add about half a cup of creamy peanut butter, the good stuff without all the added sugar.  I made my chocolate ganache recipe to throw on top and it was delicious!",

          "name": "\"Pantry Raid\" Chicken Enchilada Casserole",
          "description": "\"I made this recipe up one night when I had no idea what to do with a pound and a half of chicken tenderloins. It came out so well that my husband and I finished off the leftovers the next day and we are not usually leftover eaters. I am gluten-free so I used gluten-free cornbread mix. You will definitely enjoy it!\"Yum.  OH!  I made this as a one-dish crockpot recipe and it was delicious.  I used chicken breasts, not tenders, adding them raw to the seasoned tomato sauce mixture and cooking it all on LO for 3.5 hrs (less for tenders).  After adding in the rest and topping with the corn muffin mix, I cooked on HI for 1.5 hours.  Next time I'll add diced onion (1 sm) and 1-2 cloves minced garlic to the tomato sauce mixture, but even as is, this was great, and a keeper.  Thanks for posting!This recipe would've been great if I had followed the original recipe.  I followed the review that recommended I cook it in the crock pot.  After 5 hours, it was complete mush!  We dipped tortilla chips in it, but it was a little much to call it a main dish.  Next time I will follow the original recipe.  The flavors were great, but a little sweet.  I may look for a corn bread mix without sugar.This was so simple and fantastic!  I added red bell pepper, onion, and minced garlic; and substituted Costco rotisserie chicken pulled off the bone.  oohlala!This was easy and delicious. I didn't even  brown the chicken first. Just simmered it with the tomato sauce. My family loved it.I made this last night and thought it was great! I added some sauteed ingredients (a large minced onion, corn, chopped mixed bell pepper strips). I also added a can of Ro-Tel diced tomatoes and green chiles. I omitted the water and just used the juice from the Ro-Tel can. Lastly, I added about a teaspoon of cumin. I know it sounds like a lot of changes but at the end of the day, the basis of this recipe is great. Don't be afraid of the 1 1/2 T of chili powder. I thought it would be quite spicy with that much but it wasn't at all and I added the Ro-Tel too! Don't be afraid to continue what started this recipe in the first place...the pantry raid!This was awesome.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  For me this is pure comfort food; and it is so easy.  I cheated and used shredded rotisserie chicken, light cream cheese and substituted my customized Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread recipe with corn and jalapeños from this site instead of the cornbread mix.  So it was a super fast dinner.   Thanks for sharing a great recipe.This made a delicious and hearty meal. The only changes that I made were to use 2 cans of chicken, browned with onions and a tsp. minced garlic.  My family loved this one. I will definitely make it again.I made this tonight, and I didn't change one thing.  My husband asked for seconds and he is a picky eater. I loved the corn bread topping.",

          "description": "\"Nice soft whole wheat bread with added grains. Makes a 2 large loaves. Double recipe for 3 smaller loaves.\"So delicious!! I couldn't find vital wheat gluten, so I omitted it, but it turned out great anyway. I also added more water in the kneading process. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!should have read the reviews first, but the water/flour ratio is off.  I am somewhat new at bread and kept thinking that I was not doing something right, but it was the ratios.This is great bread! I had to make some omissions based on what I had handy (no sesame, sunflower seeds or coconut oil. I tossed in some wheat germ instead - otherwise followed the recipe except for the shape...I got 6 sandwich rolls and 1 large bunny loaf out of this. Thanks for the recipe!One detail:  If you've had breast cancer that was estrogen-receptor positive, you should avoid flax seed and flax meal.  Either leave them out, or add more of the other seeds.Let me preface this by saying I am just starting to bake bread.  It is very difficult to find a recipe with 100% whole wheat.  The only modification I made to this recipe was to add an additional 4 Tbls water as I could not get my dough to form without. I just pulled it out of the oven and my husband and I both enjoyed a slice.  Great flavor and not too dense.  Next time I am going to try using just vitamin C and omit at least some of the wheat gluten.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe for healthy bread!This was my first time attempting bread and it came out great!  I didn't have the flax seeds (added a bit extra flax seed meal) or the coconut oil (substituted toasted sesame oil) and needed to add a bit more water to get the dough to form. Tried to use my kitchenaid mixer but ended up just making it smoke -- so did all kneading by hand.  I didn't knead for full times because I got tired, but it still came out great.   The bread was a big hit and now I'm going to use it for french toast.The bread was tasty and good for sandwiches but the flour / water content was off. I used more water and approximately 5 1/2 c flour.The bread turned out beautiful.  I did have to use 2 cups of water  instead of 1/34.  Also when you cover it, don't put saran wrap on it, it will stick. It was so good.  I will make it again.",

This recipe is perfect as an after-school snack, a simple appetizer at parties, or a sweet treat before bed. Substitute Splenda® for the sugar if you like! Can be kept in a sealed bag in the freezer for several months.\"\"Spectacular\" little recipe! Ya just gotta love it when a few items you have laying around the kitchen turn into something a little extra special...  I've frozen fruit before, but never grapes. And while they're delicious with or without sugar - that addition gave regular 'ol grapes a little pizzaz.  I did use less sugar than called for and opted for Spenda which made the amount even less.  This was so easy and tasted oh so good - very nice little treat without any guilt.No sweetener necessary, even for kids' tastes, and certainly \"spa\"-healthier without! Frozen grapes are awesome just by themselves... They're like little natural popsicles!You can also use Sugar Free Jello for an added flavor.Never mind the sugar and put them on long skewers for a fun treat.  They freeze beautifully and certainly are delicious.Really pretty and oh so tasty - I didn't use nearly as much sugar as called for - maybe 1 teaspoon total - This was just enough to give the grapes that crystal effect - they actually taste a bit like a sorbet.  Thanks for a fun idea.Awesome.  We really enjoyed this sugary frozen treat on a hot evening.  No need to even complete steps 4 and 5.  The grapes went straight into the freezer inside the resealable bag.  Easy and delicious!Agree that no sugar is needed.  I freeze them in snack-sized zip lock bags so so we can grab individual servings on the go (although you must eat them before they completely defrost or they will be mushy).Our grapes were extra sweet, so we didn't use sugar. This is something we actually do quite often. Just sticking them in the freezer and getting them out two hours later works well for snacks. Mmmmmm.",

          "description": "\"Cake pan full of sinful delight. The lemon juice does all the cooking\"Cheers to the party-sized portion!  I had to make this immediately upon seeing the photo today. Used whipping cream from the refrigerated carton (on-hand), and it worked out wonderfully. This is a Restaurant-Style cheesecake for sure, only better. Used fresh, cut up, lightly sweetened strawberries on the side after chilling the cheesecake instead of using the strawberry pie filling.  Wonderful! Thank you for sharing the recipe.Good, but not my favorite. I prefer the recipe I already have. This was fantastic!! Made it the first time for 40 people &amp; got rave reviews.  I didn't put the cherries on until a couple of hours before serving &amp; my filling set up perfectly (don't know if holding off on the cherries had anything to do with that or not)!!!Excellent!!!! Oh my gosh was it ever good. We ended up serving it in bowls though as it didn't hold like a normal cheesecake does-don't worry-it's sooooo good you won't care!!!! YUM!!!! Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe!!!! Wonderful!! I hate cool-whip, so I substituted a pint of sweetened whipping cream. I also left off the cherry topping. It's a perfect alternatitive to painstakingly baking a cheesecake, especially in the summer.I now know why this is called 10 oound cheesecake.  It makes alot!  I topped my cheesecake with fresh strawberries.  This is a delicious recipe, thanks for sharing.  AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING. I have been trying to figure out how to replicate a recipe from a restaurant back home for \"no-bake\" cheesecake and this is almost IDENTICAL to it! I was thrilled w/ the huge portion too! :)  The lemon juice really adds some kick to this cheesecake. I wasn't sure if I would like it at first as I'm a very plain cheesecake lover, but this was amazing.  Next time I will add some crushed raspberries and cool whip to the top. YUMM!!!  Thanks for this great recipe!!Made this for a church gathering.  I used shredded coconut in the crust in place of the sugar and also added crushed walnuts.  Excellent.  Very easy to make and has a wonderful presence.  Thanks for posting it.",

          "description": "\"This recipe is ALWAYS a hit...with kids too! I used to call it my 'Million Dollar Salad' because buying the sesame seeds was so expensive. Now I buy the sesame seeds in bulk at a health food store and it's much more affordable.\"I have made this salad many times and it is a family favorite.  I cut oil down to 1/3 cup and use a 1/3 cup of Balsalmic vinegar.  I add chopped garlic, decrease sugar to 1/4 cup and add 5-6 packets of splenda.   This salad can also be made with Romaine lettuce and cranberries instead of cabbage for a little holiday flare.Good salad, a little sweet for my taste though.  I will definitely try it again, but will modify the amount of sugar.My whole family loves it!  Here are my modifications: I cut the sugar in 1/2.   My kids are not fans of onion so I omit them or put them on the side.  For a bit more flavor I like a bit of chopped fresh flat leaf parsley and shredded carrot(2T) which makes this salad even more vibrant looking.    A tip I'd like to share is to add about 1/2 tsp. sesame oil.  This gives a wonderful flavor.  The  dressing will  emulsify and not seperate once it's cold so chill it and whisk again before pouring on.   I like to pour the dressing about 15 minutes before eating or the ramen is too crunchy for me! :)I've added chunk cooked chicken breasts, Pinneapple and sometimes mandarin orangesMy mom used to make this when I was a kid. It is an awesome salad for either every day or to bring to a potluck.I emulsified the dressing so that it wouldn't separate overnight as I knew I'd be using the leftover dressing. Otherwise I followed the directions as written, only I keep the crunchy bits as a topping at the last minute instead of mixing in as we can't eat the whole salad in one sitting. Thanks for sharing your recipe!Great recipe.  Family loved it.  Making it again tonight.We are diabetic and looking for new and different recipes that can be tailored to our diet concerns.  I thought that I would try this one.  It was great.  I did have to make substations of course.  Splenda for the sugar and I did not use the raman noodles.  I did up the nuts a bit.  Hubby loved it and I may add more green onion.  Hubby wanted to try some chopped water chestnuts.  Thank you for sharing.",

          "name": "\"Million Dollar\" Chinese Cabbage Salad",
          "description": "\"This recipe is ALWAYS a hit...with kids too! I used to call it my 'Million Dollar Salad' because buying the sesame seeds was so expensive. Now I buy the sesame seeds in bulk at a health food store and it's much more affordable.\"I have made this salad many times and it is a family favorite.  I cut oil down to 1/3 cup and use a 1/3 cup of Balsalmic vinegar.  I add chopped garlic, decrease sugar to 1/4 cup and add 5-6 packets of splenda.   This salad can also be made with Romaine lettuce and cranberries instead of cabbage for a little holiday flare.Good salad, a little sweet for my taste though.  I will definitely try it again, but will modify the amount of sugar.My whole family loves it!  Here are my modifications: I cut the sugar in 1/2.   My kids are not fans of onion so I omit them or put them on the side.  For a bit more flavor I like a bit of chopped fresh flat leaf parsley and shredded carrot(2T) which makes this salad even more vibrant looking.    A tip I'd like to share is to add about 1/2 tsp. sesame oil.  This gives a wonderful flavor.  The  dressing will  emulsify and not seperate once it's cold so chill it and whisk again before pouring on.   I like to pour the dressing about 15 minutes before eating or the ramen is too crunchy for me! :)I've added chunk cooked chicken breasts, Pinneapple and sometimes mandarin orangesMy mom used to make this when I was a kid. It is an awesome salad for either every day or to bring to a potluck.I emulsified the dressing so that it wouldn't separate overnight as I knew I'd be using the leftover dressing. Otherwise I followed the directions as written, only I keep the crunchy bits as a topping at the last minute instead of mixing in as we can't eat the whole salad in one sitting. Thanks for sharing your recipe!Great recipe.  Family loved it.  Making it again tonight.We are diabetic and looking for new and different recipes that can be tailored to our diet concerns.  I thought that I would try this one.  It was great.  I did have to make substations of course.  Splenda for the sugar and I did not use the raman noodles.  I did up the nuts a bit.  Hubby loved it and I may add more green onion.  Hubby wanted to try some chopped water chestnuts.  Thank you for sharing.",

          "description": "\"This yummy family tradition started when buying the kids their pumpkins. Each of the kids got one to make their jack o'lanterns. Mama got one to cook! Friends and family usually enjoy this treat. Tweak it to fit your family as I do mine! Enjoy with confectioners' sugar on top or cream cheese frosting!\"Made half the recipe and used half splenda. Turned out perfectly as muffins. Pumpkn pie lke spice flavor and moist, not gooey.This was a hit! Moist and light, with a sweet and spicy flavor :) I left out the mace, chocolate, and confectioners' sugar, and used a 2 quart baking dish (9 x 13 inch pan).Delicious, moist and didn't last!!! I ended up making 3 batches because it never would have made it to our Easter gathering. I thought I would try this for a change from pumpkin pie this Easter. Everyone Loved it. I wasn't sure at first about adding the semisweet chips but my daughter insisted and the little hint of chips was prefect. I left out the walnuts. I didn't have any ginger, clove or mace in the cupboard so I substituted for 2tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I am going to make it again this weekend for an other dinner gathering.This was very easy and very good.  I followed the recipe, except that I did not have mace but instead used 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon allspice.  I added the optional chocolate chips but next time I would probably leave those out, just my personal preference.  By all means give this recipe a try.  The measurements and cooking time were spot on.  Thanks Virginia Ann for sharing your recipe.",

I couldn't find vital wheat gluten, so I omitted it, but it turned out great anyway. I also added more water in the kneading process. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!should have read the reviews first, but the water/flour ratio is off.  I am somewhat new at bread and kept thinking that I was not doing something right, but it was the ratios.This is great bread! I had to make some omissions based on what I had handy (no sesame, sunflower seeds or coconut oil. I tossed in some wheat germ instead - otherwise followed the recipe except for the shape...I got 6 sandwich rolls and 1 large bunny loaf out of this. Thanks for the recipe!One detail:  If you've had breast cancer that was estrogen-receptor positive, you should avoid flax seed and flax meal.  Either leave them out, or add more of the other seeds.Let me preface this by saying I am just starting to bake bread.  It is very difficult to find a recipe with 100% whole wheat.  The only modification I made to this recipe was to add an additional 4 Tbls water as I could not get my dough to form without. I just pulled it out of the oven and my husband and I both enjoyed a slice.  Great flavor and not too dense.  Next time I am going to try using just vitamin C and omit at least some of the wheat gluten.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe for healthy bread!This was my first time attempting bread and it came out great!  I didn't have the flax seeds (added a bit extra flax seed meal) or the coconut oil (substituted toasted sesame oil) and needed to add a bit more water to get the dough to form. Tried to use my kitchenaid mixer but ended up just making it smoke -- so did all kneading by hand.  I didn't knead for full times because I got tired, but it still came out great.   The bread was a big hit and now I'm going to use it for french toast.The bread was tasty and good for sandwiches but the flour / water content was off. I used more water and approximately 5 1/2 c flour.The bread turned out beautiful.  I did have to use 2 cups of water  instead of 1/34.  Also when you cover it, don't put saran wrap on it, it will stick. It was so good.  I will make it again.",

          "description": "\"Cake pan full of sinful delight. The lemon juice does all the cooking\"Cheers to the party-sized portion!  I had to make this immediately upon seeing the photo today. Used whipping cream from the refrigerated carton (on-hand), and it worked out wonderfully. This is a Restaurant-Style cheesecake for sure, only better. Used fresh, cut up, lightly sweetened strawberries on the side after chilling the cheesecake instead of using the strawberry pie filling.  Wonderful! Thank you for sharing the recipe.Good, but not my favorite. I prefer the recipe I already have. This was fantastic!! Made it the first time for 40 people &amp; got rave reviews.  I didn't put the cherries on until a couple of hours before serving &amp; my filling set up perfectly (don't know if holding off on the cherries had anything to do with that or not)!!!Excellent!!!! Oh my gosh was it ever good. We ended up serving it in bowls though as it didn't hold like a normal cheesecake does-don't worry-it's sooooo good you won't care!!!! YUM!!!! Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe!!!! Wonderful!! I hate cool-whip, so I substituted a pint of sweetened whipping cream. I also left off the cherry topping. It's a perfect alternatitive to painstakingly baking a cheesecake, especially in the summer.I now know why this is called 10 oound cheesecake.  It makes alot!  I topped my cheesecake with fresh strawberries.  This is a delicious recipe, thanks for sharing.  AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING. I have been trying to figure out how to replicate a recipe from a restaurant back home for \"no-bake\" cheesecake and this is almost IDENTICAL to it! I was thrilled w/ the huge portion too! :)  The lemon juice really adds some kick to this cheesecake. I wasn't sure if I would like it at first as I'm a very plain cheesecake lover, but this was amazing.  Next time I will add some crushed raspberries and cool whip to the top. YUMM!!!  Thanks for this great recipe!!Made this for a church gathering.  I used shredded coconut in the crust in place of the sugar and also added crushed walnuts.  Excellent.  Very easy to make and has a wonderful presence.  Thanks for posting it.",

          "description": "\"Delectable sponge-like cookies that are sweet and remind you of holiday seasons all year long!\"Yummy, moist and healthy! I didn't have apple butter so per another user's suggestion, I used applesauce instead. These turned out great! The spices are just the right amount. And only 1 point if you're a WW person :)i love pumpkin! this was average, expected more. if you think  of it as little drops of cake instead of a cookie, you may enjoy it better. i looked up a 5 star cream cheese frosting to add some flavor and it was better. think i'll rename these \"iced pumpkin puffs\"! probably will try another recipe though....just being honest!These were pretty good. I made half of the batch with nuts, the other without. I personally liked them better without the nuts, but that's just because I'm not a big fan of walnuts. I really liked the fluffy texture. These are lightly, not overly spiced. For some reason every time I make pumpkin cookies I have an allergic skin reaction so I have to wear latex gloves :-P Edit: Beware! These cookies get very sticky on the surface after a while. It doesn't affect the taste, but it is kind of weird.I thought they were pretty good, but they were kind of mushy on the inside. I would add a minute to the bake time, but besides that, they were fine.I LOVE these!  I thought they might be a little heavy on the spices, but the balance was perfect, and I love the slightly different texture the oats add.  These will be in my favorite cookie file for sure!  I didn't add the nuts, no one here likes nuts, but the light muffin like texture is perfect!TASTEY!! It's the end of August and I pulled out a pkg of pumpkin puree (AR's Pumpkin Puree) I had in the freezer... and then goodness happened:) As I was adding the spices I got an excited flutter in my stomach reminding me of Fall and all things autumn. Thanks for an excellent recipe. I changed a couple things out of necessity(didn't have on hand or allergy) but I'm sure it didn't change the main objective or flavor/texture, it came out as described. Changes: whole wheat instead of all purpose flour, allspice instead of pumpkin pie spice, applesauce instead of apple butter and chocolate chips instead of walnuts(allergy). Very good recipe!!!I doubled this recipe and it lasted one day with the family and friends.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  will diffently be a keeper in my recipe book!!!  Next time I might try using a cream cheese icing, but then again maybe not.  The are soft and delicious the way they are!very good and much easier to make then expected! Was also worried that they may be too spicy but they turned out perfect, only baked them for 9 mins and they were delish! Will make over and over again!",

          "description": "\"I made this recipe up one night when I had no idea what to do with a pound and a half of chicken tenderloins. It came out so well that my husband and I finished off the leftovers the next day and we are not usually leftover eaters. I am gluten-free so I used gluten-free cornbread mix. You will definitely enjoy it!\"Yum.  OH!  I made this as a one-dish crockpot recipe and it was delicious.  I used chicken breasts, not tenders, adding them raw to the seasoned tomato sauce mixture and cooking it all on LO for 3.5 hrs (less for tenders).  After adding in the rest and topping with the corn muffin mix, I cooked on HI for 1.5 hours.  Next time I'll add diced onion (1 sm) and 1-2 cloves minced garlic to the tomato sauce mixture, but even as is, this was great, and a keeper.  Thanks for posting!This recipe would've been great if I had followed the original recipe.  I followed the review that recommended I cook it in the crock pot.  After 5 hours, it was complete mush!  We dipped tortilla chips in it, but it was a little much to call it a main dish.  Next time I will follow the original recipe.  The flavors were great, but a little sweet.  I may look for a corn bread mix without sugar.This was so simple and fantastic!  I added red bell pepper, onion, and minced garlic; and substituted Costco rotisserie chicken pulled off the bone.  oohlala!This was easy and delicious. I didn't even  brown the chicken first. Just simmered it with the tomato sauce. My family loved it.I made this last night and thought it was great! I added some sauteed ingredients (a large minced onion, corn, chopped mixed bell pepper strips). I also added a can of Ro-Tel diced tomatoes and green chiles. I omitted the water and just used the juice from the Ro-Tel can. Lastly, I added about a teaspoon of cumin. I know it sounds like a lot of changes but at the end of the day, the basis of this recipe is great. Don't be afraid of the 1 1/2 T of chili powder. I thought it would be quite spicy with that much but it wasn't at all and I added the Ro-Tel too! Don't be afraid to continue what started this recipe in the first place...the pantry raid!This was awesome.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  For me this is pure comfort food; and it is so easy.  I cheated and used shredded rotisserie chicken, light cream cheese and substituted my customized Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread recipe with corn and jalapeños from this site instead of the cornbread mix.  So it was a super fast dinner.   Thanks for sharing a great recipe.This made a delicious and hearty meal. The only changes that I made were to use 2 cans of chicken, browned with onions and a tsp. minced garlic.  My family loved this one. I will definitely make it again.I made this tonight, and I didn't change one thing.  My husband asked for seconds and he is a picky eater. I loved the corn bread topping.",

          "description": "\"This recipe is ALWAYS a hit...with kids too! I used to call it my 'Million Dollar Salad' because buying the sesame seeds was so expensive. Now I buy the sesame seeds in bulk at a health food store and it's much more affordable.\"I have made this salad many times and it is a family favorite.  I cut oil down to 1/3 cup and use a 1/3 cup of Balsalmic vinegar.  I add chopped garlic, decrease sugar to 1/4 cup and add 5-6 packets of splenda.   This salad can also be made with Romaine lettuce and cranberries instead of cabbage for a little holiday flare.Good salad, a little sweet for my taste though.  I will definitely try it again, but will modify the amount of sugar.My whole family loves it!  Here are my modifications: I cut the sugar in 1/2.   My kids are not fans of onion so I omit them or put them on the side.  For a bit more flavor I like a bit of chopped fresh flat leaf parsley and shredded carrot(2T) which makes this salad even more vibrant looking.    A tip I'd like to share is to add about 1/2 tsp. sesame oil.  This gives a wonderful flavor.  The  dressing will  emulsify and not seperate once it's cold so chill it and whisk again before pouring on.   I like to pour the dressing about 15 minutes before eating or the ramen is too crunchy for me! :)I've added chunk cooked chicken breasts, Pinneapple and sometimes mandarin orangesMy mom used to make this when I was a kid. It is an awesome salad for either every day or to bring to a potluck.I emulsified the dressing so that it wouldn't separate overnight as I knew I'd be using the leftover dressing. Otherwise I followed the directions as written, only I keep the crunchy bits as a topping at the last minute instead of mixing in as we can't eat the whole salad in one sitting. Thanks for sharing your recipe!Great recipe.  Family loved it.  Making it again tonight.We are diabetic and looking for new and different recipes that can be tailored to our diet concerns.  I thought that I would try this one.  It was great.  I did have to make substations of course.  Splenda for the sugar and I did not use the raman noodles.  I did up the nuts a bit.  Hubby loved it and I may add more green onion.  Hubby wanted to try some chopped water chestnuts.  Thank you for sharing.",

This recipe is perfect as an after-school snack, a simple appetizer at parties, or a sweet treat before bed. Substitute Splenda® for the sugar if you like! Can be kept in a sealed bag in the freezer for several months.\"\"Spectacular\" little recipe! Ya just gotta love it when a few items you have laying around the kitchen turn into something a little extra special...  I've frozen fruit before, but never grapes. And while they're delicious with or without sugar - that addition gave regular 'ol grapes a little pizzaz.  I did use less sugar than called for and opted for Spenda which made the amount even less.  This was so easy and tasted oh so good - very nice little treat without any guilt.No sweetener necessary, even for kids' tastes, and certainly \"spa\"-healthier without! Frozen grapes are awesome just by themselves... They're like little natural popsicles!You can also use Sugar Free Jello for an added flavor.Never mind the sugar and put them on long skewers for a fun treat.  They freeze beautifully and certainly are delicious.Really pretty and oh so tasty - I didn't use nearly as much sugar as called for - maybe 1 teaspoon total - This was just enough to give the grapes that crystal effect - they actually taste a bit like a sorbet.  Thanks for a fun idea.Awesome.  We really enjoyed this sugary frozen treat on a hot evening.  No need to even complete steps 4 and 5.  The grapes went straight into the freezer inside the resealable bag.  Easy and delicious!Agree that no sugar is needed.  I freeze them in snack-sized zip lock bags so so we can grab individual servings on the go (although you must eat them before they completely defrost or they will be mushy).Our grapes were extra sweet, so we didn't use sugar. This is something we actually do quite often. Just sticking them in the freezer and getting them out two hours later works well for snacks. Mmmmmm.",

          "description": "\"I did a combination of two recipes, peanut butter cookies with three ingredients and magic cookie bars. My brother-in-law loves magic cookie bars but is now gluten-free. I have been trying to come up with desserts for him so he doesn't feel left out. This is an amazing dessert and will stay fresh for days...if they last that long in your house! Perfect for Passover - no flour!\"I absolutely appreciate that someone took the time to find a gluten-free alternative crust to these bars. Thank you for offering an idea I would never have thought of on my own!\n\nAfter having made them, I believe that the peanut butter cookie base makes the squares far far too sweet and rich, and the peanut taste totally overpowers the rest of the nuts in the bars. At least for my tastes, anyway. My husband and his dad liked them, but they could only eat one square at a sitting.\n\nMy oven sucks, so I only realized later that the cookie base didn't cook/set as much as I would have liked. I would recommend longer than 8 minutes, and at a higher temp to at least set the PB.\n\n**It was easy to make and prep.** If you don't normally have these ingredients in your cupboard, you can save money by only buying the amount you need in the bulk section of your grocery store.\n\nI am going to try to find a gluten-free crust that is more like the original base I knew and loved when I ate gluten. Something less overpowering than the peanut butter.\n\nAll in all, nice to be able to make something to take to holiday parties that was gluten-free, but not many people ate them, and no one took a second.I make these for My Brother in Law who is Gluten Free. You can \"tweak\" the recipe and add tons of different kinds of nuts and chocolate candies and carmel on top. I switch it up all the time. Works best with parchment paper in the bottom of the pan.

          "name": "\"Pantry Raid\" Chicken Enchilada Casserole",
          "description": "\"I made this recipe up one night when I had no idea what to do with a pound and a half of chicken tenderloins. It came out so well that my husband and I finished off the leftovers the next day and we are not usually leftover eaters. I am gluten-free so I used gluten-free cornbread mix. You will definitely enjoy it!\"Yum.  OH!  I made this as a one-dish crockpot recipe and it was delicious.  I used chicken breasts, not tenders, adding them raw to the seasoned tomato sauce mixture and cooking it all on LO for 3.5 hrs (less for tenders).  After adding in the rest and topping with the corn muffin mix, I cooked on HI for 1.5 hours.  Next time I'll add diced onion (1 sm) and 1-2 cloves minced garlic to the tomato sauce mixture, but even as is, this was great, and a keeper.  Thanks for posting!This recipe would've been great if I had followed the original recipe.  I followed the review that recommended I cook it in the crock pot.  After 5 hours, it was complete mush!  We dipped tortilla chips in it, but it was a little much to call it a main dish.  Next time I will follow the original recipe.  The flavors were great, but a little sweet.  I may look for a corn bread mix without sugar.This was so simple and fantastic!  I added red bell pepper, onion, and minced garlic; and substituted Costco rotisserie chicken pulled off the bone.  oohlala!This was easy and delicious. I didn't even  brown the chicken first. Just simmered it with the tomato sauce. My family loved it.I made this last night and thought it was great! I added some sauteed ingredients (a large minced onion, corn, chopped mixed bell pepper strips). I also added a can of Ro-Tel diced tomatoes and green chiles. I omitted the water and just used the juice from the Ro-Tel can. Lastly, I added about a teaspoon of cumin. I know it sounds like a lot of changes but at the end of the day, the basis of this recipe is great. Don't be afraid of the 1 1/2 T of chili powder. I thought it would be quite spicy with that much but it wasn't at all and I added the Ro-Tel too! Don't be afraid to continue what started this recipe in the first place...the pantry raid!This was awesome.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  For me this is pure comfort food; and it is so easy.  I cheated and used shredded rotisserie chicken, light cream cheese and substituted my customized Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread recipe with corn and jalapeños from this site instead of the cornbread mix.  So it was a super fast dinner.   Thanks for sharing a great recipe.This made a delicious and hearty meal. The only changes that I made were to use 2 cans of chicken, browned with onions and a tsp. minced garlic.  My family loved this one. I will definitely make it again.I made this tonight, and I didn't change one thing.  My husband asked for seconds and he is a picky eater. I loved the corn bread topping.",
