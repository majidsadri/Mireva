(i still think the movie is pretty funny, though.) in the movie, the dictator of a tiny little country called parador indulges in a drink called a \"puna,\" which is never really described. \"too many damn punas,\" and the dictator kicks the bucket, and richard dreyfus' character, an actor who does too good an impression of the departed, has to take his place while the corrupt political cronies figure out what to do next. anyhow, we thought it'd be fun to create the puna. what we came up with was pretty darn tasty, and was a hit on those binge weekends of old. i don't remember the exact recipe, and we made it in volume, but here's an approximate single serving.  delicious!  :)",

    "description": "we don't have salmon often, but this looked so easy & yum that it inspired us to get down to the fishmongers. we used 2 salmon fillets but kept all the other measurements the same & added a handful of sugar-snap peas with the baby spinach. it's simple enough for a weeknight meal and impressive enough to serve guests.\r\ni found this recipe (originally printed in delicious magazine, in australia - july 2007) on taste.com.au along with some helpful reviews: this is a sweet dish, so people suggested the addition of some lime juice. i liked the idea, and added some, but i'll leave it up to you :)",

    "description": "this restaurant quality pasta dish is absolutely delicious.  the luscious, creamy, tomatoey vodka sauce is rich, slightly spicy, with just a zing of vodka.  penne alla vodka became quite popular in the late 80‘s and is still popular today… normally it includes real cream for richness but i'm using reduced-fat milk.  great news though, it still retains the decadent flavor of a regular recipe but with a fraction of the fat and calories.  in addition, i've placed it over fiber rich whole wheat penne instead of white pasta.  the key to this sauce is using a premium vodka…  it adds a clean, fresh taste.   a less expensive brand will give a harsh taste. this skinny pasta dish has only 347 calories, and 7 grams of fat compared to sbarro’s penne alla vodka at 640 calories and 28 grams of fat.  hope you try it soon.  it’s simply delicioso…",

    "description": "when martha stewart first published this recipe in her martha stewart living magazine in 1995, she had an entire article explaining the \"where's/how's/and what not to do's\" with regards to lemon curd. i had only ever purchased lemon curd prior to this recipe, and wasn't impressed with it. too thick, too tart and short shelf life for the very high price. this recipe changed my mind: soft, teasingly tart, the ability to make it tarter or softer in flavour all had me saying \"this is the world's best lemon curd!!!\" i've never tried another recipe since, even martha's \"new & improved\" curd recipes, where she seems to have forgotten what she taught us fans of hers, so many years ago.\r\n\r\naccording to the article, the reasons why this curd recipe is so superior is the following:1) beating the egg yolks until rich yellow and then straining the first time creates a smooth, albumen-free base. 2) cooking the mixture without the zest creates a \"softer\", less bitter curd. cooked zest just becomes more bitter, even without the white pith. 3) a second straining removes any possibility of \"scrambled eggs\" from your curd! 4) adding the chilled butter, cut into pieces,  to the eggs does two things: it rapidly cools down the curd so it doesn't continue to cook and also the buttery flavour is not changed by cooking with the yolks! 5) adding the zest after the curd is cooled creates a smooth, flavourful but not bitter curd!\r\n\r\nare these steps too many for some people? oh, i'm sure of it, especially the straining steps. and some curd recipes have you dump everything together in the pan so that sure makes it simple. however, after 15 years of making this one curd recipe, i've found the little bit of extra time involved in creating it makes for a superiour end product. \r\n\r\nnote: if you do not want a dense, eggy lemon curd, use whole eggs for the recipe, rather than egg yolks. that would be four whole eggs to the six egg yolks.",

    "description": "this recipes comes from me trying to \"fix\" another recipe on the site but it ended up being a whole new recipe. i think it turned out very well, and it's something we really enjoy. make it as sweet or spicy as you like by messing with the amounts of brown sugar (not the molasses!) and chili flakes. enjoy! this recipe includes sauce for rice but be careful, if you cook it too long the chicken will soak up the sauce fast, if your looking for more of a sticky glaze, cook it a little longer and leave the lid off during most of the cooking. i have only made it sticky without the vegetables added, so if your worried about overcooking, wait to add or cook them separately. i would also suggest chopping into pieces when raw and pan frying the chicken to help seal it some so it doesn't break down as much when cooking. i would be wary reducing the amount of water to reduce cooking time, as it changes the flavor, and not for the better imho.",

(you need to yield 4-5 cups shredded chicken).  to save time, cook the chicken ahead of time and refrigerate it so that it's cooled and ready to go when you put the casserole together.",

    "description": "i found this stuffed in my recipe box.  i'm not sure where i found it, but i decided to try this with gyros.  these were delicious!  \r\nthe recipe wasn't specific on the temperature of the water, & after i had all of the ingredients in the pan, i remembered that i should have used warm water (120-130 degrees f).  but i goofed & used cold water.  i thought i'd try it anyways & if it didn't work i'd just make another batch.  but i got lucky, because it raised just fine.  i also used all-purpose flour.  \r\nthis was my first time making pita bread, so for any of you who are new to making pitas as well, here are some tips for rolling them out.  \r\n\r\nif you roll them out to 6-7 inches, they do not puff very much & you can use them like a tortilla.  however, if you roll them a little smaller (some of mine just didn't want to stretch to 6 inches) & have them a little thicker (not too much) they puff up & you can cut them in half for pita pockets.  for some wierd reason, this really impressed me!  \r\n\r\nnote:  if you use a stone pan to bake these, bake for 4 minutes & do not turn.\r\n\r\n*prep time varies for all bread machines, so i didn't list that part.  my prep time was 1 hour, 20 minutes.",

    "description": "very good greek stew, i love the addition of cinnamon to the meat!  the original recipe also calls for 1 tsp salt, which i leave out as we try to reduce our sodium intake as much as possible.  i also leave out the onions because i don't care for them and the stew still has plenty of flavor that way, in my opinion.  we do this in the crock pot, but the original says that you can cook the stew in a heavy kettle, covered, for 1 1/2 hours.",

(time for marinading is included in the cooking time)",

    "description": "when i help out with fundraisers for some of my kids sporting events, i always make a huge pot of spaghetti, but some people don't like red meat so i make a batch of this chicken spaghetti and it goes so fast it's gone in minutes!   my kids hate mushrooms, so i cut up the 'shrooms real small to avoid their complaints, but i think they really make this recipe great - feel free to cut the mushrooms up large or small as you like.  :)   this recipe reminds me of stroganov but it's the chicken version.",
