Check the back of the shrimp and when you see the colour change about half way up, turn them over. Do the same on the other side. This should only take a minute to two minutes maximum on both sides  otherwise you will get a rubbery result if you leave it too long. Squeeze over the lime juice  this too should bubble and reduce.",

The real key is to use a very strong mushroom broth (either make your own or use twice the amount called for with the instant), and to brown all the ingredients first.In a large stewpot on med-hi heat, saute onions in beer until very brown and beginning to stick to pot bottom",
      "Add just enough mushroom broth to loosen the onions on the bottom of the pan and continue browning. Keep up this process until onions are very dark brown.At the same time, in a large skillet, pour 1/4 cup mushroom broth and add cubed tofu. Brown on all sides as much as possible on med-hi, adding broth when tofu starts to stick, loosening the tofu cubes and cooking until they start to stick again. When tofu cubes are browned well, add to onions and add rest of mushroom broth. If more liquid is needed, add water to cover stew if more liquid is needed.In same skillet, using water, use same process on carrots and mushrooms, browning and loosening with water and then add to the stew mixture.Finally, add crushed garlic, cover and simmer until full flavor has developed.This process of browning really increases the flavor of all the contents including the tofu. Don't be afraid to make plenty, as this disappeared fast and there were not enough leftovers for my taste!"

      "Add 1 tablespoon of sugar. Stir well to combine and leave to simmer on a low heat. The sauce will get very thick. Dont add water here because when the fish is placed in to cook, it will introduce alot of moisture to the sauce.",
      "When the sauce has been simmering gently for 2 to 3 mins, taste the sauce. Adjust the taste here because every brand of oyster sauce/tamarind/wine is different and the sauce needs to be fine tuned accordingly. If its too sour, add a little more sugar. If it tastes flat, add a little wine and oyster sauce. Stir well to combine.",
      "When the sauce is ready, gently add the fish into the pan. Keep the stove at medium heat and let the fish cook slowly in the sauce. Try not to handle the fish too much in the sauce as it will cause the fish to flake or break up.",
      "As the fish cooks, it will release moisture into the sauce and thin it out. Gently cover the fish with the sauce. Cover the pan and let it simmer till the fish is cooked through. It usually takes about 5 to 8 minutes depending on the thickness of the fish.",
      "When the fish is cooked, add the red capsicum strips and gently stir through till they are warmed through but not cooked till soft. If the sauce is too thick at this point, add a couple of tablespoons of water and stir well to combine.",

There is nothing more important to a Punjabi man's diet than bread, and meals are accompanied by flat round cornbread rotis or rich, flaky pan-fried paratha layered with ghee(clarified butter).Rice is reserved for special occasions or for rice pudding, for the only food that makes a Punjabi feel he has eaten a proper meal is his bread!

      "Brush inner flesh with oil, season with salt and pepper and roast in a 400 F oven, cut side up in a baking dish until tender, about 30-40 min.",
      "Mix together the chicken, enchilada sauce, beans, corn, olives, cilantro and cheese (save some of the cheese for topping).Scrape the sides of the spaghetti squash so the \"noodles\" are tossed and more loose.Divide the enchilada mixture between the squash boats and top with the extra cheese you saved.Broil in the oven until the cheese is melted and golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.",
      "Garnish with cilantro and top with avocado slices (if using)."

Boiling the chicken in broth, however, will give it significantly more flavor. Bring the chicken broth/stock to a boil and put in whole chicken breasts. Cook until no pink remains. Depending on the size of the chicken breasts, this could take anywhere from 15 - 20 minutes.While the chicken is boiling, put together your sauce.",

This ensures that the juice stays in the chicken instead of spilling out when you cut it!Dice up the chicken and mix it into the sauce.",

Soak the wood chips in cold water to cover for 1 hour and drain.Meanwhile, light a large chimney starter filled halfway with charcoal (about 3 quarts) and allow to burn until the coals are partially covered with a layer of ash. Build a modified two-level fire by arranging all the coals over half of the grill, leaving the other half empty. Open the bottom grill vents completely.",
      "Place the wood chips on the coals. Set the cooking grate in place, cover and heat the grate until hot, about 5 minutes. Use a grill brush to scrape the cooking grate clean. Sip a wad of paper towels in vegetable oil; holding the wad with tongs, oil the cooking grate.Set the aluminum pan with the roast on the grate opposite the coals. Open the grill lid vents three-quarters of the way and cover, making sure the vent is above the meat to draw smoke through the grill. Cook, adding about eight briquettes every hour or so to maintain an average temperature of 275F for three hours. (When I added coals, I also basted the marinade over the roast to ensure moistness.)Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 325F. Wrap the pan holding the roast, being careful not to spill the marinating liquid, with heavy duty aluminum foil to cover completely.",
      "Place the pan in the oven and cook until the meat is fork-tender, about 2 hours.Carefully slide the foil-wrapped pan with the roast into a brown paper bag. Crimp the end shut.",
      "Let rest for 1 hour. (I found it easiest to lay the paper bag open on its side and slide the roast in, instead of dropping it downward, then folding the opening up and taping it shut.)While roast is resting, prepare barbecue sauce. If wanting true South Carolina style barbecue sauce, make the marinade above. If wanting a thicker, tangier sauce with a hot finish, I highly recommend Inas barbecue sauce below. Its a bit of an ingredient dump with 11 of 13 items being from jars and bottles, but with flavors so loud and clamoring for your taste-buds attention, you wont regret it.In a large sauce pan on low heat, saute onions and garlic with the oil until the onions are translucent, about 10 to 15 minutes.",
      "Add the rest of the ingredients. Simmer uncovered on low heat for 30 minutes. Use immediately or store in fridge. Makes about 6 cups.Keeping: This sauce freezes excellently. I made a big batch last fall and froze it, pulling it out for the pulled pork. I re-heated in a sauce pan on low heat until hot.Once pork has rested, transfer the roast to a carving board and dispose of the marinade liquid and pan. When cool enough to handle, separate the roast into sections, removing fat if desired, and tear the meat into shreds with your fingers (forks work just as well without your fingers getting messy).",
      "Place the shredded meat in a large bowl. Toss with 1 cup of the barbecue sauce, adding more to taste.",
      "Serve, passing the remaining sauce separately."

    "ingredients": [
      "250gr / 0.5 lb. (dry weight) of good quality fettuccini pasta",
      "550gr / 1.2 lb. Brussels sprouts, cleaned and chopped quite finely, but not too small.",
      "2 x shallots chopped finely",
      "2 x large cloves of garlic chopped finely",
      "150gr / 5 oz. smoked bacon chopped into small pieces",
      "2 x eggs, beaten just enough to bring them together, then set them aside",
      "Lots of freshly ground black pepper",
      "75gr / 2.5 oz. finely grated parmesan cheese",
      "Salt to taste",
      "2 x tbsp of olive oil"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Heat the oil in a non-stick pan.  When it reaches a medium high heat, add the shallots and garlic and saut for a minute.",
      "Add the sprouts, cook until they are browned and become a little softer ( not too soft though, you dont want them to be mushy, but to retain a little bite).  You can probably get going with cooking the pasta when the sprouts are nearly finished.  Just follow the instructions on the packet for timings.  The best way to cook pasta is to put it into a pan with plenty of boiling water and a good helping of salt.",
      "When the sprouts are cooked, move them to the outside area of the pan and add the bacon to the centre, allowing it to cook for a couple of minutes, turning a couple of times.",
      "When the bacon is cooked, mix it through the sprouts and give a good grind of black pepper and a little salt.  Careful with salt as the bacon and the parmesan will also add a salty flavour.",
      "When the pasta is ready, bring your two pans close together on the stove.  Then, with tongs, grab the pasta and drag is swiftly into the pan with the sprouts.  By doing this you take in some of the pasta water.  This water helps bind and create your sauce.  You dont need  much, in this case probably about 2 tablespoons worth.  This dragging technique should ensure that you have enough.",
      "Turn the heat off under your sprouts and pasta.",
      "Add the egg (not directly on to the base of the pan but onto the pasta mixture) add the parmesan.  Stir through quite quickly, this will create a creamy style sauce.",
      "Check for seasoning, and serve immediately with some extra parmesan sprinkled over the top if you wish.",
      "This works well with all sorts of pasta.  The only type that doesnt work so well for a carbonara style dish is whole meal or gluten free varieties.  These pastas seem to lack the starchy constituent that gives your sauce that creamy texture.",
      "Try using pecorino cheese instead of parmesan"

If you must make and serve it on the same day, just be sure it is  refrigerated at least 4 hours before serving.",

You can enjoy it with a glass of white wine, but my personal faves would be a Cadillac margarita, or an icy cold beer. Buen Provecho!"

Set aside to dry.Meanwhile, heat the safflower oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat.  I highly recommend you use a cast iron skillet, both for its heat retention and for its natural non-stick nature.   Bring the oil just below its smoking point  you should see light whisps of smoke, but not much more than that.Ensure the surface of each scallop is as dry as possible to encourage browning.",

After 60 seconds, lift the edge of one of the scallops to check for brownness.  If it is golden brown, flip it over and give it another 90 seconds.  If not, let it sit for another 30 seconds.  Cooked scallops can still be translucent in the middle, but cook them to a doneness youre comfortable with.",

Toss in the french beans and let them sizzle for about a minute, soaking up the great flavor the scallops have left behind.To plate, lay down a pile of beans and divide the scallops between two plates.  Top with the salsa mixture, and a little extra sesame seeds, if you so desire."

Cook until lightly brown on all sides.Turn up the heat, rough chop your head of radicchio, removing the core and cook down for a couple of minutes until the radicchio wilts.Turn the heat down, chop up your prosciutto or bacon and add to the pan. You want to render the fat of this slowly - if you have the heat too high, the pork will crisp up & become chewy - you dont want this with the soft radicchio.Allow to cook until most of the moisture in the pan has cooked out. The radicchio & pork should still be soft. Season with salt & pepper.",

Next add the diced onions, corn, and shrimp to the pan, another 5 minutes. If there is excess water/liquid, discard carefully and set aside on lowest heat setting. Optional: Cooking each ingredient separately (pepper, carrot / garlic, onion / shrimp) to ensure that they cook consistently is perfectly fine, but it will add another 5~10 minutes to your cooking time.",
      "In another pan or skillet, scramble 2 eggs in generous amount of oil. When finished, add eggs to the main skillet with other ingredients. Optional: Prepare 4 sunny-side up eggs for the topping/garnish.",
      "On low heat, add cooled rice, butter, soy sauce and oyster sauce and mix thoroughly with spoon (wooden works best). Make sure to coat sauce on rice and rest of ingredients well; this will take a few minutes and some hand/wrist strength from continuous mixing.",
      "Plate the fried rice topped with a sunny-side up egg. If wanting a semi-round shape (see pic above), stuff fried rice in a round bowl pressing down firmly. Set the bowl upside down on a plate; the fried rice should sit upright in a round shape. Enjoy with kimchi and other banchan (side dishes).",
      "*Some people like to stir fry the ingredients separately because they cook at different times. For fried rice, this can be skipped since the main point is to get them slightly tender; this means cooking the harder veggies (carrots) first and adding the softer ones (onions) later. This will save you valuable minutes in cooking time and the hassle of washing unnecessary, extra dishes."

I just knead it right in the bowl.  Stop kneading as soon as the dough comes together and is soft and not too stickydo not over knead!  Try to knead it no more than 10 times if that helps.Form a ball, place it in the center of the mixing bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest in a warm spot for 20 minutes.After 20 minutes the dough wont really look any different, dont worry about it.  Divide the dough into 8 sections and roll into balls.Re-cover the balls with the plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes.On a floured surface roll the balls out, either in a round or oval shape.  Meanwhile heat an iron skillet (or just plain skillet if thats all you have) on medium-high heat.Whack the rolled out dough onto the hot skillet and cover with a lid.  In less than the time you can roll out another ball the first side will be done, check the bread, when its nice and bubbly on the raw side flip it over and cook for a few more seconds.Thats it, get it out of the pan and put it on a plate or in your mouth or whatever! yum!"

You will need 3 of them for the actual sheets and 1 for decorative crumbs, which you can easily make with your fingers.Now for the cream: Beat the eggs with the sugar and flour. Boil the milk. While the milk is warming, pour about 1/2 cup into the egg mix and stir well to gradually increase its temperature. This way the eggs wont curdle when you add them to boiling milk. Repeat this step 2-3 more times as the milk approaches boiling temperature.Once the milk boils, pour the warm egg mix into the boiling milk, constantly stirring, to prevent lumps from forming. Keep on the stove for several 3 more minutes, continue stirring. Its best to use hand held mixer in this stage.",

Bring this mix to a gentle simmer and stir occasionally. Do this until the tapioca is translucent and tender, this takes about 20 minutes. When cooked, stir in the coconut milk.While the tapioca mix is cooking you can whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl - quite big as it has to hold half of your tapioca mix too.",
      "Mix the egg and sugar together until the color lightens.Taking your cooked tapioca mix from the heat, pour half of it into the bowl with the eggs and sugar, whisk together using a metal hand whisk. Then pour this back into the pan and place on a medium heat.On a medium heat keep whisking until the mix thickens, this takes about 5 minutes or so. It is important not to use too high a heat as the eggs will scramble. The mix will not become really thick, the chilling process with thicken it further. I like to check the sweetness level at this stage, you can add a little more sugar if you wish, but if you do, stir it through until it dissolves. Put your tapioca pudding in a clean, cool bowl, remove the vanilla bean and set aside to cool. When it has cooled, cover with cling film and put in the fridge.Now for the pineapple.",
      "Combine the fruit with the honey, lime juice and most of the zest. Keep back a little lime zest to dress.",
      "Place half of the mix in a food processor and blend until smooth.",
      "Transfer this back into the bowl with the rest of the pineapple and stir together  check the flavour and add more honey or lime if you wish.Once your tapioca has chilled, place some of the pineapple mix in the bottom of your serving dishes, then add the tapioca and top with a little pineapple and some lime zest to finish."

      "In a large bowl, add instant corn masa mix, water, baking powder, salt, and olive oil to create corn masa mix. The mixture should be spongy.",
      "Whats surprisingly tricky is assembling the tamales. The best technique Ive found is to thinly spread the tamale masa mix starting from the right-hand side of the corn husks, and leaving about 2 inches on the left-hand side of the husk. When rolling the tamale together, take the right-hand side and fold it onto the rest of the corn husk covered with tamale masa mix. The 1-2 inches left over should roll perfectly over the actual tamale. Dont overstuff the tamales! Id say 2 tablespoon of meat mixture and just a sparse amount of cheese.",
      "O cook, you should have a double boiler. If you dont, like me, then use a metal colander and place it in a large pot.",
      "Place the tamales in the colander (or double boiler) where they are not squished, nor are they loose enough to unravel themselves. While doing this, boil 2 cups of water in the pot or what equates to 1 inch in height of the water.",
      "Once water comes to a boil, reduce heat and add the tamales.",
      "Place a towel between the colander and lid, and cook for 30 minutes."

If you're not lactose intolerant, you could use a cake mix for the cupcakes, but you will have to double the other ingredients."

      "In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, salt, and sugar.",
      "Add butter and pulse until the mixture resembles the size of small peas.",
      "Add the first 5 tablespoons of water, one at a time.Check consistency - if the mixture holds together when pinched, the crust is perfect  dont add any more water.If, however, the crust still crumbles apart and wont stay together when pinched, that means it wont stay together while rolling either; go ahead and add the last tablespoon of water one teaspoon at a time, rechecking the consistency between each teaspoon.The exact amount of water you need will depend on the amount of humidity in the air and therefore in the flour.Once finished, turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap.Form the dough into a disk, and refrigerate 30 minutes before rolling it out.You want that flour to relax and the butter to be nice and cold  that will ensure you have a nice flaky crust.Meanwhile, boil a pot of water large enough to fit the stalks of asparagus.Trim the ends of your asparagus making sure they will fit nicely into your quiche pan, arranged like the spokes in a bicycle wheel with the ends touching in the middle.",
      "Place in boiling water, and blanch for 2-3 minutes.",
      "Remove from boiling water and place in an ice bath to stop the cooking and keep the color nice and vibrant green.Set aside.Preheat oven to 350 degrees.On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a circle a few inches larger than your quiche or pie pan.Fold the dough back up over the rolling pin if needed, to gently lift the crust into the dish.Once the dough is neatly into the pan, make sure it is smoothly tucked into the corners.Trim excess crust from the edges leaving about a 1 border.Fold the excess dough under itself, making sure not to fold it over the edge of the pan, to ensure a nice even border.Crimp the dough between your fingers to make little pinches.Poke a few fork holes in it to allow the steam to escape, this will prevent a soggy bottom crust.Blind bake the crust for 5 minutes.This will prevent all of the custard from getting absorbed into the crust making it soggy.",
      "Remove crust from oven and sprinkle with Havarti with Dill cheese.  Set aside.Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees.In a large bowl, combine eggs, heavy cream, and milk and whisk thoroughly.",
      "Pour egg mixture gently over the cheese mixture.",
      "Place asparagus stalks, tips pointing outwards into a spoke pattern like on a bicycle wheel, making sure the ends come together in the middle.",
      "Bake 40 minutes.Check to make sure the crust isnt getting too brown.If it is, loosely drape a piece of foil over the top, making sure you dont lay it on the actual custard mixture in the middle.",
      "Bake 10-12 minutes longer.To test doneness, slide a butter knife under the edge of one of the asparagus stalks.The knife should come out clean.It should be moist  after all the quiche is moist, but it should be free of egg mixture.If not, put it back in the oven with your tent foil on top for 3-4 more minutes."

This dessert has 273 calories, 6g of protein, and 10g of fat per serving. For $1.55 per serving, this recipe covers 6% of your daily requirements...",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 teaspoon butter",
      "2 tablespoons double cream",
      "1 large egg, lightly beaten",
      "1 cup flour",
      "2 Granny Smith apples chopped",
      "50g ground almonds",
      "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
      "juice of half a medium lemon",
      "225g plain, full-fat cream cheese, softened",

      "1/2 cup sugar (feel free to use Splenda Baker's Mix... I do and it is just as delicious.",
      "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract"

    "steps": [
      "Crust: Using a stand mixer or handheld electric whisk, cream the butter, sugar and vanilla together until lightened. By hand, gently mix in the flour and almonds. Press the resulting crumbs into a 25cm loose-bottomed tin (or several smaller ones if you have decided to make individual servings).Custard: Using a stand mixer or handheld electric whisk, cream together the cream cheese and sugar.",
      "Add the egg and vanilla and mix to completely combine.",
      "Pour into the prepared (uncooked) crust.Apples: Slice the apples as thinly as possible - a mandoline is good for this. Toss gently in the sugar, cinnamon and lemon. Leave to soften for 10 minutes or so. Arrange in a layer on top of the custard. Start by laying overlapping apple slices all the way round the edge. Next create the 'rose' - arrange the slices in a spiral, standing the apple slices a little on their edge, until the centre hole is completely filled in. Save the smallest, thinnest pieces for the very centre as they will have to bend the most. Cover the tart with tin foil and bake in a preheated oven set at 190c for 30 minutes (this step helps soften the apples).",
      "Remove the foil and bake for 15-25 minutes longer, until the custard is puffed and the apple edges are lightly browned.Glaze: When you take the tin foil off the apple tart, start making the glaze. Melt the sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until rich and golden.",
      "Add the butter and salt and stir to combine.",
      "Add the cream and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the ingredients have formed a smooth, unified caramel. When the tart looks nearly ready, remove it from the oven and brush with the glaze. Return to the oven and cook for a further few minutes until the glaze is gently bubbling. Cool to room temperature.  Can be kept in the fridge for several days - store in the baking tin and wrap well."

The chocolate may hold its shape when you remove it from the microwave, but it will be soft, so stir to melt it. If pieces remain after you have stirred it for a while then return to microwave for another few seconds and then stir again until it is fully melted. Be careful not to overheat the chocolate. You are better off starting with less time and reheating than overheating and ruining it.When chocolate has melted add the sugar and vanilla and stir with a whisk to combine.",
      "Let it cool a little and then add the eggs, one at a time, whisking after each addition. Don't add the eggs when the chocolate is hot because it may cook the whites.Once the eggs are mixed in, place the flour in a strainer and sift over the chocolate mixture, a little at a time, mixing it in as you sift it over. Set aside while you prepare the cream cheese layer.For the cream cheese layer, place the cream cheese in a bowl and mix with a hand mixer for a couple of minutes until soft.",

      "Add egg and beat to incorporate.",
      "Add Bailey's and stir it in.To assemble, spray an 8\" square baking pan with straight sides with non-stick spray, or butter and flour it. You can also line the baking pan with parchment, leaving the edges high so you can lift the entire cake out of the pan.",
      "Pour the chocolate mixture into the pan and tilt it to spread it out evenly.",
      "Pour the cream cheese mixture over it, and with a fork, swirl the layers so some of the chocolate shows on top and the cream cheese layer becomes part of the chocolate layer. Do not over mix - you just want some swirls.",
      "Place in a preheated 350 degree F oven and bake for 35 minutes or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Do not over bake.",
