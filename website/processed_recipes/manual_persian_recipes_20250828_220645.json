    "description": "A rich Persian stew with pomegranate, walnuts, and chicken, creating a perfect sweet-and-sour balance",
    "ingredients": [
      "4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into small chunks",
      "1 large onion, peeled, minced",
      "2 cups shelled walnuts, finely ground",
      "1 cup pomegranate molasses, plus more if needed",
      "1/4 cup sugar, plus more if needed",
      "Dash of cinnamon",
      "Vegetable oil",
      "Salt and pepper to taste"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Pulse the walnuts a few times in a food processor until finely ground.",
      "In a small pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Add the walnuts and sauté them lightly for 2-3 minutes, stirring often.",
      "Add the pomegranate molasses and 2 cups of water to the pan. Mix well, cover with the lid slightly ajar, and simmer over low heat for 30-40 minutes.",
      "In a large heavy-bottomed pot, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Sauté the onions until golden brown.",
      "Add the chicken pieces to the pot and cook until golden on all sides. Add salt, pepper, and a small dash of cinnamon. Start with 1/2 teaspoon of salt; you can adjust later.",
      "Pour the pomegranate-walnut mixture into the pot with the chicken. Stir well, adding water if needed, so the chicken is fully covered, and brought back to a boil. Then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 2 hours. The slow cooking allows the chicken, walnuts, and pomegranate sauce to become rich and creamy.",
      "Add sugar 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing gently without breaking up the chicken. Taste and adjust to your preference. Fesenjoon is traditionally a balanced, sweet-and-sour (malas) dish.",
      "If the fesenjoon is too thin, leave the lid slightly ajar and simmer until it reaches a thick consistency. Fesenjoon should never be watery.",
      "Serve hot with aromatic basmati rice."
